# Lúmina · Immersive Botanical Dining

A five-page concept website for **Lúmina**, an imagined botanical fine-dining restaurant in Toronto. The experience blends storytelling, sensory-driven cuisine, and avant-garde design. The site is completely static (HTML/CSS/JS) and highlights:

- A luminous landing page introducing the Equinox Reverie tasting menu and signature immersive spaces.
- A filterable menu that lets guests explore tasting movements, à la carte selections, libations, and plant-based offerings.
- An experience hub detailing the Resonance Lounge, Chef's Observatory, Whispering Conservatory, and a private Synesthetic Salon.
- A reservations portal with a concierge-style form, private salon highlights, and dynamic confirmation messaging.
- An about page celebrating the creative collective behind Lúmina and the restaurant's regenerative philosophy.
